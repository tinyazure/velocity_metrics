## 🔗 Data Relationships

The model uses a star schema with automatic relationships:

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   Accounts      │
                    └──────┬──────────┘
                           │
                    [account relationship]
                           │
    ┌────────────┐─────────┼─────────┬────────────┐
    │            │         │         │            │
┌───▼───┐  ┌────▼────┐ ┌──▼───┐ ┌──▼────┐  ┌──▼────┐
│Prod.  │  │Sales    │ │Sales │ │Data   │  │Dates  │
│ucts   │  │pipeline │ │teams │ │Dict.  │  │(Auto) │
└────────┘  └─────────┘ └──────┘ └───────┘  └───────┘
```
